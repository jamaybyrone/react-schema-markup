# `react-schema-markup`

`react-schema-markup` is a simple and flexible Node package that allows React developers to easily generate structured data for Google Search and other search engines. It provides React components for various schema types, helping you to enrich your website with structured data and enhance your presence in search results, including rich results like carousels, product listings, and more.

This package aims to streamline the integration of [Google's Structured Data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data) into your React app with pre-built React components that generate valid JSON-LD markup.

## Usage
Each component in react-schema-markup accepts props that are used to populate the structured data in JSON-LD format. Below is an example of `RichBreadCrumbs`. For more examples and usages please see the tests folder.

### SSR
Each component takes a Wrapper component ```ScriptWrap``` this is to allow to pass in custom scrip tags:

```tsx
import Script from 'next/script'
import RichBreadCrumbs from 'react-schema-markup/dist/RichBreadCrumbs'
...

<RichBreadCrumbs ScriptWrap={Script} />
```

`RichBreadCrumbs` **Component**

The Breadcrumbs component generates structured breadcrumb data for a website.
```tsx
import RichBreadCrumbs from 'react-schema-markup/dist/RichBreadCrumbs'
...

<RichBreadCrumbs/>
```

Given this url: https://www.example.com/tester/big/spender

This will produce:
```json
{
      "@context": "https://schema.org",
      "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
      "itemListElement": [
        {
          "@type": "ListItem",
          "position": 1,
          "name": "Home",
          "item": "https://www.example.com"
        },
        {
          "@type": "ListItem",
          "position": 2,
          "name": "Tester",
          "item": "https://www.example.com/tester"
        },
        {
          "@type": "ListItem",
          "position": 3,
          "name": "Big",
          "item": "https://www.example.com/tester/big"
        },
        {
          "@type": "ListItem",
          "position": 4,
          "name": "Spender",
          "item": "https://www.example.com/tester/big/spender"
        }
      ]
    }
```
Given this url which has a locale of en: https://www.example.com/en/tester

This will produce:
```json
{
      "@context": "https://schema.org",
      "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
      "itemListElement": [
        {
          "@type": "ListItem",
          "position": 1,
          "name": "Home",
          "item": "https://www.example.com/en"
        },
        {
          "@type": "ListItem",
          "position": 2,
          "name": "Tester",
          "item": "https://www.example.com/en/tester"
        }
      ]
    }
```
Props:
- `supportedLocales` (string[]): Optional parameter, to take into consideration locales.
- `includeTrailingSlash` (boolean): By default this is false.

If your url is like: https://www.example.com/subdirectory/cat

and you expect it to return:
```json
{
      "@context": "https://schema.org",
      "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
      "itemListElement": [
        {
          "@type": "ListItem",
          "position": 1,
          "name": "Home",
          "item": "https://www.example.com"
        },
        {
          "@type": "ListItem",
          "position": 2,
          "name": "Cat",
          "item": "https://www.example.com/subdirectory/cat"
        }
      ]
    }
```
Then this isn't for you and you're not invited to my birthday party, sort your directories out.
